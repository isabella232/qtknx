    \brief The QKnxAddress class represents a 16-bit KNX address value.

    KNX is a fully distributed network, which accommodates up to 65,536 devices
    in a 16-bit individual address space. Concrete address \l {Type}{types}
    are \e {group address} and \e {individual address}.
*/

/*!
    \enum QKnxAddress::Type
    This enum describes the supported KNX address types.

    \value Group        A group address is a 2-byte value that does not need to
                        be unique. A device may have more than one group address.
    \value Individual   An individual address is a 2-byte value that needs to be
                        unique within a KNX installation.
*/

/*!
    \enum QKnxAddress::Notation
    This enum describes the supported human-readable representation of KNX
    addresses.

    \value TwoLevel
        The visual representation will be main group and sub group, separated
        by a forward slash.
    \value ThreeLevel
        The visual representation for \l {Type}{group addresses} will be main,
        middle, and sub group separated by a forward slash, while \l {Type}
        {individual addresses} will be formatted as area, line, and sequential
        number, separated by a dot.

    \note Only group addresses support 2-level notation.

        \li 3-level notation, such as 1/1/1 for group addresses or 1.1.1
